## Introduction

### Justification 

Generative language models mediate communicative processes with humans and the psychological mechanisms of AI-mediated communication (AI-MC). People use AI to autocomplete or craft entire messages for their digitally communicative practices. My research program revolves around understanding how humans construct the identity of themselves and others with media (AI is of growing interest). As identity becomes psychologically salient while crafting a message online, we know communicators are likelier to bend or break the truth about themselves. AI plagiarism of a dating profile bio is unique in that the content of the message may be factually correct, yet the credit for compositional skill and cues given off from the AI-generated bio take advantage of pretenses. This study will verify the accuracy with which message receivers can identify AI-plagiarized biographies. Attempting to replicate this study will bring me up to speed on managing the analytic chain of research and allow me to get my hands dirty with collecting and analyzing crowd worker data for the first time. The methods of analysis and statistics computed for the study are also challenging to me but not outside of my potential capability for the next eight weeks.

### Stimuli and Procedure 

The stimuli for this project are not publically available but are retrievable from my advisor and co-author on the original project, Jeffrey Hancock. The project has a repository with all data and procedures available on OSF. The supplemental materials that describe data-collection procedures for the six studies in the original paper are in this directory.

The procedure for this experiment is relatively straightforward, using the AI-generated messages provided by the original authors. If training and scraping a new set of stimuli becomes more appropriate, this would be outside of my current skillset but would be possible if I wanted to take the paper to publication. The original study recruited 1,000 gender-balanced participants on Prolific and sampled from 1,000 user-generated dating bios and 1,000 AI-generated dating bios. They then briefed the participants on their task to identify the bios generated by AI, which they completed in a digital format. 

Regarding challenges, I’ve never run an experiment by myself from start to finish, nor have I been the sole analyst on a dataset. Conducting the statistical analysis, managing the analytic pipeline, and keeping data organized by myself without the help of others will be enough of a challenge for me. If I’m completing the project with too much ease, I’ll find ways to produce a more complete and challenging procedure.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
