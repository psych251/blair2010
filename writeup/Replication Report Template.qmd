## Introduction

### Justification 

The deception-identification framework for social-psychological research consistently generates the finding that people humans have the same accuracy for lie detection as flipping a coin. Many researchers implement 2x1 designs to test different theoretical perspectives on the nature of deception identification. In this study, the findings in study 5 from this paper indicate participants were significantly better at identifying deception when provided context. This replication project seeks to extend the analysis to a new medium, misinformation identification. Managing this analytic pipeline is a new challenge but not outside my potential capability for the next eight weeks.


### Stimuli and Procedure 


The stimuli for this project can come from two places: 

I have a set of 40 social media stimuli (half accurate, half untrue news headlines on Twitter/X) that I will present to prolific participants, with (independent variable) or without context (control) information.
Gather original videos from the authors of the paper and embed those into Qualtrics. 


The procedure for this experiment is relatively straightforward. The original study recruited 25 gender-imbalanced participants (60% identified as women) from a college campus and used video tapes from a prior experiment about employee theft.  They then briefed the participants on their task to recognize the deceivers in each video. Participants placed in the control group had no context information. Participants in the treatment group were given context.

Regarding challenges, I’ve never run an experiment by myself from start to finish, nor have I been the sole analyst on a dataset. Conducting the statistical analysis, managing the analytic pipeline, and keeping data organized by myself without the help of others will be enough of a challenge for me. If I’m completing the project with too much ease, I’ll find ways to produce a more complete and challenging procedure. Ben and I talked about Bayesian factors as a way to take the study beyond comparing means with t-tests and SE.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

The differences in accuracy were 69% for detecting false statements in the treatment group compared to 42% in the control group. The sample in this study is much too small, and having a much more powerful microscope will get findings closer to describing the effect of context, assuming some degree of ground truth. 

The study reports statistics in a confusing manner: “Participants in the context group were more accurate overall (69%) and scored more hits (69%) on the deceptive materials than those in the control group [control group accuracy = 42 and 33%, t(23) = 3.03, p < .01, d = 1.2 and t(23) = 3.59, p < .01, d = 1.4, respectively].” Not signifying which test refers to true or false in the control group, and does not report numbers for the treatment group. 

This study replication will follow significance threshold conventions of p=.05. 

The original study does not report a metric for power. My replication will aim for a capacity of 0.90 or 0.95.



### Planned Sample

For power =.95, required sample size for cohen's d= 1.2, p=.05: 40 

For power =.90 required sample size for cohen's d= 1.2, p=.05: 32

For power =.85 required sample size for cohen's d= 1.2, p=.05: 28

For power =.80 required sample size for cohen's d= 1.2, p=.05: 24 


### Materials

"Four cases were selected from the corpus of videos first reported by Horvath, Jayne, and Buckley (1994). Each of these cases involved an employee theft of money from an employer. The cases were selected because they each contained two and only two primary suspects. One of the suspects was deceptive (guilty) and one was truthful (innocent) in each case as established by the evidence-corroborated confession of the deceptive party (see Horvath et al., 1994, for more information on the videos). From the four cases, two truthful and two deceptive suspects were randomly selected and placed in random order on a video; thus, participants saw only one of the two prime suspects from each case."

This will be adopted to an alread-validated set of social media news-headlines posts, 20 true and 20 false. 

Topics range civic issues, health, politics, science and technology. 

I anticipate needing a larger sample size than 40. The adapted study reported effect sizes of d=1.2 and d=1.4.


### Procedure	

"Twenty-five students (60% females, mean age = 27.6, SD = 9.7) at a large university in the southwestern United States were randomly placed into either the context (n = 13) or the control group (n = 12). Participants in the context group received a case file that contained a brief summary of the background of the prime suspects and the general scenario regarding the missing money. They were instructed to read the case file prior to viewing the relevant video. Participants in the no-context group did not receive this information. Both groups viewed the videos and rendered dichotomous truth–deception judgments."

**For replication** the sample size will likely be more than twice as big than the original authors, and will be as closed to representative as possible in regard to gender and similar demographics. 

Procedure will vary only around stimuli, replacing deception videos with misinformation-possible Twitter posts. 

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Key analysis: two-tailed, two-sample t-test. (Potential Bayesian factor analysis)**

With accuracy data collected through Prolific/Qualtrics: 

1) Run python script to anonymize data. 

2) Filter for: Treatment group true news accuracy, treatment false news accuracy, control group true news accuracy, treatment false news accuracy. 

3) Run two-sample, two-tailed t-tests for each accuracy type and each treatment. 

Data cleaning rules: this should be straightforward. This should be analyzed with TaT. It's likely that all participants that start the study will finish it. No identifying data is required. 


### Differences from Original Study

This shifts the stimuli to be more practical for the prolific funding available to the class. The videos from the original study are long, and having participants identify misinformation would be closer to my topic of interest. Other differences include sample size (this will be larger) and the potential for new analyses. 

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

### Confirmatory analysis

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
